# Greedy Algorithms

A greedy algorithm is an approach to problem-solving that involves making the locally optimal choice at each stage without reconsidering previous decisions.

It focuses on selecting the best option available at the moment, aiming to achieve the most immediate benefit without considering the long-term consequences.

However, it's important to note that greedy algorithms do not guarantee the best solution for all problems and may sometimes yield suboptimal results.

## Advantages
The advantage of using a greedy algorithm is that solutions to smaller instances of the problem can be straightforward and easy to understand. Also, it works in some cases, especially where the optimal solution of the subset is the solution for the superset as well.

## Disadvantages
The disadvantage of the greedy algorithm is that sometimes the most optimal short-term solutions may lead to the worst possible solution to the whole problem!
