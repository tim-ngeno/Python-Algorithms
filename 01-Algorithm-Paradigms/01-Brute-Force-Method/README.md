# Brute Force Method.

The Brute Force method to solve a problem requires going through all the possibilities to find a solution to a problem.

For instance, given a list of integers and tasked to find the min, max,
or a specific value, "x" in the list, the Brute Force approach requires going through all the elements to find the specific value "x".

## Linear Search - Example
Linear search, also called Sequential search, goes through each element
in a list, one after the other, to find the specified element.


## Time Complexity:
**O(n)**: We would have to do `n` comparisons in the worst case. This means that the list has to be completely traversed

### Advantages
- Brute force method is guaranteed to find a solution if one exists

### Disadvantages
- The method is inefficient in terms of performance
