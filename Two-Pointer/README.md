# two-pointer problem

The two-pointer problem is a technique used to solve problems where you need to find a pair of elements in an array (or a linked list) that satisfy a certain condition. The two-pointer approach involves using two pointers, typically named "left" and "right," to traverse the array (or linked list) in opposite directions.

One common example of a two-pointer problem is finding a pair of elements in a sorted array that add up to a target sum. Let's use this problem as an example to illustrate the two-pointer approach.

Problem: Given a sorted array of integers and a target sum, find a pair of elements in the array that add up to the target sum.
