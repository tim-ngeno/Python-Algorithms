## Problem Statement: Valid Palindrome

#### Problem Description:
Write a function that determines if a given string is a valid palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. The function should return true if the input string is a valid palindrome, ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and considering case sensitivity.

#### Input:
- A string containing alphanumeric characters and possibly punctuation.

#### Output:
- Return true if the input string is a valid palindrome, and false otherwise.

#### Constraints:
- The input string may contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- The function should ignore non-alphanumeric characters and consider case sensitivity.
- The length of the input string will not exceed a certain limit.

#### Example:
- Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
  Output: true
- Input: "race a car"
  Output: false

#### Note:
- The function should handle edge cases such as empty strings or strings with only non-alphanumeric characters.
- Implement an efficient algorithm to solve the problem, considering time and space complexity.
