# Fast and Slow pointers

The fast and slow pointer technique, also known as Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm or the tortoise and hare algorithm, is a method used to detect cycles in linked lists or arrays. It involves using two pointers that traverse the data structure at different speeds.

The fast and slow pointer technique is commonly used to solve problems related to linked lists and arrays, such as:
- Detecting a cycle in a linked list
- Finding the middle node of a linked list
- Flattening a linked list
- Reversing a linked list

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the size of the linked list or array, as both pointers traverse the data structure once. The space complexity is O(1) since only a constant amount of extra space is used for the pointers.
